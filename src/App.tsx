      question: "2. Explain DDA Line Drawing Algorithm with example.",
      answer: "📌 Most repeated question",
      codeExample: `
⭐ DDA Line Drawing Algorithm
✅ Simple Meaning

DDA (Digital Differential Analyzer) is a line drawing algorithm used to draw a straight line on screen by 
calculating intermediate points between two endpoints.

It works by calculating small steps in x or y direction and finding the next pixel position.



⭐ Formula Used

For line between two points:
(x₁, y₁) → (x₂, y₂)


Step 1: Calculate Differences
Δx = x2 – x1
Δy = y2 – y1


Step 2: Find max number 
Steps = max(|Δx|, |Δy|)


Step 3: Find increment

Xinc = Δx / Steps
Yinc = Δy / Steps


step 3: increment with X and Y

x = x + Xinc
y = y + Yinc

👉 Each calculated value is rounded to nearest integer pixel.
These incremental calculations are the base of DDA line generation. 


---------------------------------------------------------


⭐ Steps of DDA Algorithm

Step 1

Input starting point (x₁, y₁) and ending point (x₂, y₂)


Step 2

Calculate
Δx and Δy


Step 3
Find number of steps

Steps = max(|Δx|, |Δy|)


Step 4
Find increment

Xinc = Δx / Steps
Yinc = Δy / Steps


Step 5

Plot first point


Step 6

Repeat steps times
Add increments and plot next point


---------------------------------------------------------


⭐ Example (Very Important)

Given

(x₁, y₁) = (5, 6)
(x₂, y₂) = (13, 10)

Step 1
Δx = 13 – 5 = 8
Δy = 10 – 6 = 4


Step 2
Steps = max(8,4) = 8


Step 3
Xinc = 8 / 8 = 1
Yinc = 4 / 8 = 0.5


Step 4 Plot Points

| Step  | X  | Y        |
| ----- | -- | -------- |
| Start | 5  | 6        |
| 1     | 6  | 6.5 → 7  |
| 2     | 7  | 7        |
| 3     | 8  | 7.5 → 8  |
| 4     | 9  | 8        |
| 5     | 10 | 8.5 → 9  |
| 6     | 11 | 9        |
| 7     | 12 | 9.5 → 10 |
| 8     | 13 | 10       |



⭐ Advantages of DDA

✅ Simple and easy to implement
✅ Easy mathematical calculation
✅ Faster than basic line equation method

⭐ Bresenham’s Line Drawing Algorithm
✅ Simple Meaning

Bresenham’s Line Drawing Algorithm is an efficient algorithm used to draw a straight line using only 
integer calculations.

It avoids floating point operations and rounding, so it is faster and more accurate than DDA.


⭐ Basic Idea

Instead of calculating slope (m), it uses a Decision Parameter (P) to decide which pixel to choose next.

At each step, we choose between:

  East pixel (E)
  North-East pixel (NE)

depending on the value of the decision parameter.



⭐ Decision Parameter Formula (For |m| < 1)

Given line from

      (x0​,y0​)→(xn​,yn​)


Step 1: Calculate

      Δx=xn​−x0​
      Δy=yn​−y0
      
      
Step 2: Initial Decision Parameter

      P0​=2Δy−Δx


Step 3: Update Rules

if Pk < 0
      Pk+1​=Pk​+2Δy

👉 Choose E pixel
👉 x increases by 1
👉 y remains same


if Pk >= 0
      Pk+1​=Pk​+2Δy−2Δx

👉 Choose NE pixel
👉 x increases by 1
👉 y increases by 1


⭐ Steps of Algorithm

1️⃣ Input starting and ending points
2️⃣ Calculate Δx and Δy
3️⃣ Calculate initial decision parameter
4️⃣ Plot first point
5️⃣ For each x:
If P < 0 → choose E
Else → choose NE
  6️⃣ Repeat until end point reached




⭐ Numerical Example (Very Important)

Given:

      (x0​,y0​)=(5,6)
      (xn​,yn​)=(13,10)

  
Step 1: Calculate Differences
      Δx=13−5=8
      Δy=10−6=4


Step 2: Initial Decision Parameter

      P0​=2(4)−8
      P0​=8−8=0


Step 3: Constants

      2Δy=8
      2Δy−2Δx=8−16=−8


Step 4: Iteration Table

| Step  | Pk            | Decision   | Next Point |
| ----- | ------------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| Start | 0             | P ≥ 0 → NE | (6,7)      |
| 1     | 0 + (-8) = -8 | P < 0 → E  | (7,7)      |
| 2     | -8 + 8 = 0    | NE         | (8,8)      |
| 3     | 0 + (-8) = -8 | E          | (9,8)      |
| 4     | -8 + 8 = 0    | NE         | (10,9)     |
| 5     | 0 + (-8) = -8 | E          | (11,9)     |
| 6     | -8 + 8 = 0    | NE         | (12,10)    |
| 7     | 0 + (-8) = -8 | E          | (13,10)    |



⭐ Advantages of Bresenham

✔ Uses only integer calculations
✔ No floating point
✔ Faster than DDA
✔ More accurate
✔ Less memory usage

⭐ Disadvantages

❌ Slightly complex logic
❌ Basic version works for |m| < 1 (needs modification for other slopes)



⭐ Comparison: Bresenham vs DDA (⭐ VERY IMPORTANT)

      question: "4. Explain Midpoint Circle Algorithm with example.",
      answer: "📌 Very important circle algorithm",
      codeExample: `
⭐ Midpoint Circle Algorithm
✅ Simple Meaning

Midpoint Circle Algorithm is used to draw a circle using only integer calculations.

It is based on the circle equation:
      x2+y2=r2

Instead of calculating every point, it checks the midpoint between two possible pixels and decides which 
pixel is closer to the circle.



⭐ Basic Idea

For each step, we choose between:

  East (E) → (x+1, y)
  South-East (SE) → (x+1, y-1)

Decision depends on the Decision Parameter (P).

Because circle is symmetric, we calculate points for one octant only and use symmetry to get remaining 7 
octants.



⭐ Initial Conditions

For circle centered at (0,0):

Starting point:

      (x0​,y0​)=(0,r)

Initial decision parameter:

      P0​=1−r


⭐ Decision Parameter Update

If Pk​<0

👉 Midpoint is inside circle
Choose East pixel

      Pk+1​=Pk​+2xk​+3


If Pk​≥0

👉 Midpoint is outside circle
Choose South-East pixel

      Pk+1​=Pk​+2xk​−2yk​+5


Repeat until x≥y



⭐ Steps of Algorithm

1️⃣ Input radius r and center (xc, yc)
2️⃣ Set x = 0, y = r
3️⃣ Compute initial P = 1 − r
4️⃣ Plot 8 symmetric points
5️⃣ While x < y:
  x = x + 1
  If P < 0 → update using first formula
  Else → y = y − 1 and update using second formula
  6️⃣ Repeat



⭐ Numerical Example (Very Important)

Given:

Radius r = 10
Center = (0,0)


Step 1: Initial Values

  x0​=0
  y0​=10
  P0​=1−10=−9


Step 2: Iterations

| Step | x | y  | P  | Decision          |
| ---- | - | -- | -- | ----------------- |
| 0    | 0 | 10 | -9 | P<0 → E           |
| 1    | 1 | 10 | -6 | E                 |
| 2    | 2 | 10 | -1 | E                 |
| 3    | 3 | 10 | 6  | SE                |
| 4    | 4 | 9  | 1  | SE                |
| 5    | 5 | 8  | 2  | SE                |
| 6    | 6 | 7  | 9  | Stop (x ≥ y soon) |

Now reflect these points in all 8 octants.


⭐ 8-Way Symmetry of Circle

If calculated point is (x, y)

Other points are:

(x,y)
(y,x)
(−x,y)
(−y,x)
(−x,−y)
(−y,−x)
(x,−y)
(y,−x)




⭐ Advantages

✔ Uses only integer arithmetic
✔ Faster than direct equation method
✔ Efficient for raster display
✔ Easy to implement

⭐ Disadvantages

❌ Slight inaccuracy due to pixel approximation
❌ Circle may not be perfectly smooth


⭐ Short Exam Definition

Midpoint Circle Algorithm is an incremental algorithm that uses a decision parameter to determine the 
nearest pixel to form a circle using 8-way symmetry.

      answer: "📌 10–12 mark long answer possibility",
      codeExample: `
⭐ Midpoint Ellipse Algorithm
✅ Simple Meaning

The Midpoint Ellipse Algorithm is used to draw an ellipse using an incremental method.

It is similar to the midpoint circle algorithm but works with the ellipse equation:

      x2        y2
      _    +    _   =  1
      rx2      ry2
      

It uses a decision parameter to decide the next pixel position.
The ellipse uses 4-way symmetry (not 8 like circle).
      


⭐ Basic Idea

The first quadrant of ellipse is divided into two regions:

🔹 Region 1

Slope > -1
Move mainly in x direction

🔹 Region 2

Slope < -1
Move mainly in y direction

After calculating points in first quadrant, reflect them in other 3 quadrants.



⭐ Initial Setup

Given:
      rz = x-radius
      ry = y-radius
      Center = (x_c , y_c)
      
Start point:
      (x0​,y0​)=(0,ry​)



⭐ Decision Parameter – Region 1
Initial decision parameter:

      P1 0​​= ry2​ − rx2 ​ry ​+ 1 ​rx2​
                           -
                           4
                     

🔹 Region 1 Steps
While:
      2ry2​x<2rx2​y

if P1​<0

👉 Midpoint inside ellipse
Choose (x+1, y)

      P1(k+1)​=P1k​+2ry2​x+ry2​



if P1​≥0

👉 Midpoint outside ellipse
Choose (x+1, y-1)

      P1(k+1)​=P1k​+2ry2​x−2rx2​y+ry2​




⭐ Decision Parameter – Region 2

Initial value:
              
    P2 0 = ry2 ​(x+1/2​)^2 + rx2 ​(y−1)^2 − rx2 ​ry2​




🔹 Region 2 Steps

While y ≥ 0:


if P2​>0

👉 Choose (x, y-1)

  P2(k+1)​=P2k​−2rx2​y+rx2​


if P2​≤0

👉 Choose (x+1, y-1)

  P2(k+1)​=P2k​+2ry2​x−2rx2​y+rx2​



⭐ Complete Steps of Algorithm

1️⃣ Input rx,ry and center (x_c , y_c)
2️⃣ Start at (0 , r_y)
3️⃣ Calculate initial P₁
4️⃣ Process Region 1
5️⃣ Calculate initial P₂
6️⃣ Process Region 2
7️⃣ Apply 4-way symmetry



⭐ 4-Way Symmetry

If calculated point is (x, y)


Other points are:

(x,y)
(−x,y)
(x,−y)
(−x,−y)

Add center coordinates:

x=x+xc​

      answer: "📌 Frequently asked question.",
      codeExample: `
Flood Fill Algorithm

The Flood Fill Algorithm works by starting from a seed pixel and spreading to neighboring pixels that have 
the same target color until the boundary is reached.

Basic Idea

1. Start from a seed point (x, y).
2. Check if the pixel has the target color.
3. Change it to the replacement color.
4. Repeat the process for neighboring pixels.
5. Stop when pixels are different from the target color or already filled.
      

Types of Connectivity

Flood fill can be implemented using two connectivity methods.


1. 4-Connected Method

In the 4-connected method, a pixel is connected to four neighbors:

Left (x−1, y)
Right (x+1, y)
Up (x, y−1)
Down (x, y+1)


Diagram

       (x,y-1)
          |
(x-1,y) (x,y) (x+1,y)
          |
       (x,y+1)


Characteristics

  Checks only horizontal and vertical neighbors.
  Diagonal pixels are not considered connected.


Algorithm (4-Connected Flood Fill):

FloodFill4(x, y, targetColor, replacementColor)

1. If pixel(x, y) ≠ targetColor
       return

2. Set pixel(x, y) = replacementColor

3. FloodFill4(x+1, y, targetColor, replacementColor)
4. FloodFill4(x-1, y, targetColor, replacementColor)
5. FloodFill4(x, y+1, targetColor, replacementColor)
6. FloodFill4(x, y-1, targetColor, replacementColor)
      

-----------------------------------

2. 8-Connected Method

In the 8-connected method, a pixel is connected to eight neighbors, including diagonals.

Neighbors:

Left (x−1, y)
Right (x+1, y)
Up (x, y−1)
Down (x, y+1)
Top-left (x−1, y−1)
Top-right (x+1, y−1)
Bottom-left (x−1, y+1)

Boundary Fill Algorithm
Definition

The Boundary Fill Algorithm is a computer graphics algorithm used to fill a region with a specified color 
starting from a seed point until a boundary color is reached.

The algorithm stops filling when it encounters the boundary color of the region.

It is commonly used in paint and drawing applications to color enclosed shapes.


Working Principle

1. A seed point inside the region is selected.
2. The algorithm checks the color of the pixel.
3. If the pixel is not the boundary color and not already filled, it fills the pixel.
4. The algorithm then repeats the process for neighboring pixels.
5. The process continues until the boundary color is encountered.


--------------------------------------


4-Connected Boundary Fill Method

In the 4-connected method, the algorithm checks four neighboring pixels:

Left (x−1, y)
Right (x+1, y)
Up (x, y−1)
Down (x, y+1)


Steps (Algorithm):

BoundaryFill4(x, y, fillColor, boundaryColor)

1. If pixel(x, y) is not boundaryColor 
   and pixel(x, y) is not fillColor then

2. Set pixel(x, y) = fillColor

3. Call BoundaryFill4(x+1, y, fillColor, boundaryColor)
4. Call BoundaryFill4(x-1, y, fillColor, boundaryColor)
5. Call BoundaryFill4(x, y+1, fillColor, boundaryColor)
6. Call BoundaryFill4(x, y-1, fillColor, boundaryColor)


Neighbor Structure

       (x,y-1)
          |
(x-1,y) (x,y) (x+1,y)
          |
       (x,y+1)


   
8-Connected Boundary Fill Method

In the 8-connected method, the algorithm checks eight neighboring pixels including diagonals.

Neighbors:

Left (x−1, y)
Right (x+1, y)
Up (x, y−1)
Down (x, y+1)
Top-left (x−1, y−1)
Top-right (x+1, y−1)
Bottom-left (x−1, y+1)
Bottom-right (x+1, y+1)


Steps (Algorithm):

BoundaryFill8(x, y, fillColor, boundaryColor)

1. If pixel(x, y) is not boundaryColor 
   and pixel(x, y) is not fillColor then

2. Set pixel(x, y) = fillColor

3. BoundaryFill8(x+1, y, fillColor, boundaryColor)
4. BoundaryFill8(x-1, y, fillColor, boundaryColor)
5. BoundaryFill8(x, y+1, fillColor, boundaryColor)
6. BoundaryFill8(x, y-1, fillColor, boundaryColor)

7. BoundaryFill8(x+1, y+1, fillColor, boundaryColor)
8. BoundaryFill8(x-1, y-1, fillColor, boundaryColor)
9. BoundaryFill8(x+1, y-1, fillColor, boundaryColor)
10. BoundaryFill8(x-1, y+1, fillColor, boundaryColor)


Neighbor Structure

(x-1,y-1) (x,y-1) (x+1,y-1)
(x-1,y)   (x,y)   (x+1,y)
(x-1,y+1) (x,y+1) (x+1,y+1)


Example

Suppose we have a circle drawn with a black boundary and the inside is white.

  Boundary color = Black
  Fill color = Blue
  Seed point = Any pixel inside the circle

Steps:

1. Select a pixel inside the circle.
2. Check whether it is boundary color.
3. Fill it with blue.
4. Repeat for neighboring pixels.
5. Stop when black boundary pixels are reached.

Result:
The entire region inside the circle becomes blue while the boundary remains black.

      question: "14. Difference Between Flood Fill and Boundary Fill",
      answer: "",
      codeExample: `
1️⃣ Flood Fill Algorithm

Flood Fill looks at the color inside the shape.

Example:

Before fill

########
#      #
#      #
#      #
########

Inside color = white


If you click inside with red, it fills all white pixels.

########
#RRRRRR#
#RRRRRR#
#RRRRRR#
########

👉 It fills all connected pixels of the same color.


2️⃣ Boundary Fill Algorithm

Boundary Fill looks at the border color.

Example:

Boundary color = #

########
#      #
#      #
#      #
########


When filling starts:

It keeps filling until it touches # (boundary).
It stops at the border.

      
Easy Trick to Remember

🟢 Flood Fill → checks INSIDE color
🔵 Boundary Fill → checks BORDER color



1️⃣ Flood Fill Algorithm

Idea: Fill all connected pixels having the same interior color.

Algorithm

1. Start with a seed point (x, y) inside the region.
2. Check the color of the pixel.
3. If the pixel color = old color, change it to new color.
4. Repeat the process for neighbor pixels:

    (x+1, y)
    (x-1, y)
    (x, y+1)
    (x, y-1)

5. Continue until all connected pixels of the old color are filled.


Short Definition (Exam)

Flood Fill: A filling algorithm that replaces all connected pixels of the same interior color starting from a 
seed point.



2️⃣ Boundary Fill Algorithm

Idea: Fill the region until the boundary color is reached.

Algorithm

1. Start with a seed point (x, y) inside the region.
2. Check the pixel color.
3. If pixel color ≠ boundary color and ≠ fill color, then:
    Change it to fill color.
4. Repeat for neighboring pixels:

(x+1, y)
(x-1, y)
(x, y+1)
(x, y-1)

5. Stop when boundary color is reached.



Short Definition (Exam)

Boundary Fill: A filling algorithm that fills a region until a specified boundary color is encountered.

      question: "15. Explain Anti-Aliasing and its methods.",
      answer: "📌 Theory question often asked.",
      codeExample: `
What is Anti-Aliasing?

When we draw a line or curve on a computer screen, the edges look zig-zag or stair-shaped because the 
screen uses square pixels.

Example (jagged edge):

#####
    #####
         #####

This stair shape is called aliasing.
Anti-Aliasing is a method used to make edges look smooth.


Example (smoother edge):

######
  ######
    ######

The computer changes pixel brightness (color intensity) near the edges so the line looks smoother.



Methods of Anti-Aliasing

1. High Resolution Display

Idea

Use more pixels on the screen.
When pixels are very small, edges look smoother.

Example:

Low resolution

#  #  #
 #  # 

High resolution

########
 #######
  ######

Simple Meaning
More pixels → smoother image.



2. Post Filtering (Supersampling)

Idea

Each pixel is divided into smaller parts (sub-pixels).

Example:

Pixel

|----|
|____|

Divide into 4 parts:

|--|--|
|__|__|

The computer checks color in each small part and then averages them.

Result → smoother edges.



3. Pre Filtering
Idea

The computer checks how much of a pixel is covered by the object.

Example:

Pixel coverage

[████ ] 80% covered

The pixel color becomes 80% bright.
If only 20% is covered → lighter color.
This creates a smooth edge effect.



4. Pixel Phasing

Idea

The computer slightly changes pixel brightness near edges.

Example:

Dark pixel
Medium pixel
Light pixel

### 
 ## 
  #

By changing brightness, the edge looks smoother.


Very Simple Summary

| Method          | Idea                                |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| High Resolution | Use more pixels                     |
| Supersampling   | Divide pixels into small parts      |
| Pre Filtering   | Calculate how much pixel is covered |
| Pixel Phasing   | Adjust pixel brightness             |

⭐ VERY IMPORTANT TRANSFORMATION QUESTIONS
These are almost guaranteed.

What is 2D Transformation?

In 2D Transformation, we change the position, size, or shape of an object in 2D space (x, y plane).

Example:

Move an object
Rotate an object
Increase size
Flip shape

All these are transformations.


Types of 2D Transformations

We will learn 5 types:

1. Translation
2. Rotation
3. Scaling
4. Reflection
5. Shearing
      


-----------------------------------------
TRANSLATION IN 2D TRANSFORMATION
-----------------------------------------

Definition:
Translation moves an object from one position to another 
without changing its size, shape, or orientation.

If a point P(x, y) is translated by:
Tx = translation in x-direction
Ty = translation in y-direction

New coordinates become:

x' = x + Tx
y' = y + Ty


-----------------------------------------
HOMOGENEOUS COORDINATES
-----------------------------------------

To use matrix multiplication in computer graphics,
we convert the point (x, y) into homogeneous form:

P = (x, y, 1)


-----------------------------------------
2D TRANSLATION MATRIX
-----------------------------------------

T = | 1   0   Tx |
    | 0   1   Ty |
    | 0   0   1  |


-----------------------------------------
MATRIX MULTIPLICATION
-----------------------------------------

| 1  0  Tx |     | x |     | x' |
| 0  1  Ty |  ×  | y |  =  | y' |
| 0  0  1  |     | 1 |     | 1  |


After multiplication:

x' = x + Tx
y' = y + Ty


-----------------------------------------
EXAMPLE
-----------------------------------------

Original Point:
P(2, 3)

Translation values:
Tx = 4
Ty = 2

Translation Matrix:

| 1  0  4 |
| 0  1  2 |
| 0  0  1 |

Point Matrix:

| 2 |
| 3 |
| 1 |

Multiplication:

x' = (1*2) + (0*3) + (4*1) = 6
y' = (0*2) + (1*3) + (2*1) = 5

New Point:
P'(6, 5)


-----------------------------------------
KEY POINTS
-----------------------------------------

1. Translation moves an object from one location to another.
2. Shape and size do NOT change.
3. Translation uses Tx and Ty values.
4. Homogeneous coordinates (x, y, 1) are used.
5. Translation matrix is 3×3.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


-----------------------------------------
ROTATION IN 2D TRANSFORMATION
-----------------------------------------

Definition:
Rotation means turning an object around a fixed point
(usually the origin) by a certain angle.

Rotation changes the orientation of the object
but the shape and size remain the same.

Angle of rotation = θ (theta)

Positive angle  → Counter-clockwise rotation
Negative angle  → Clockwise rotation


-----------------------------------------
ROTATION FORMULA
-----------------------------------------

If a point P(x, y) is rotated by angle θ about the origin,
the new coordinates become:

x' = x cosθ − y sinθ
y' = x sinθ + y cosθ


-----------------------------------------
2D ROTATION MATRIX
-----------------------------------------

R = | cosθ   -sinθ |
    | sinθ    cosθ |


-----------------------------------------
MATRIX MULTIPLICATION
-----------------------------------------

| cosθ  -sinθ |     | x |     | x' |
| sinθ   cosθ |  ×  | y |  =  | y' |


After multiplication:

x' = x cosθ − y sinθ
y' = x sinθ + y cosθ


-----------------------------------------
EXAMPLE
-----------------------------------------

Rotate point P(1, 0) by 90° counter-clockwise.

Values:
cos90° = 0
sin90° = 1

Rotation Matrix:

| 0  -1 |
| 1   0 |

Point Matrix:

| 1 |
| 0 |

Multiplication:

x' = (0*1) + (-1*0) = 0
y' = (1*1) + (0*0) = 1

New Point:
P'(0, 1)


-----------------------------------------
KEY POINTS
-----------------------------------------

1. Rotation turns an object around a fixed point.
2. Shape and size do NOT change.
3. Angle θ determines how much the object rotates.
4. Rotation matrix uses cosθ and sinθ.
5. Counter-clockwise rotation is considered positive.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


-----------------------------------------
SCALING IN 2D TRANSFORMATION
-----------------------------------------

Definition:
Scaling changes the size of an object in computer graphics.

It can either enlarge or shrink the object.

Sx = scaling factor in x-direction
Sy = scaling factor in y-direction


-----------------------------------------
SCALING FORMULA
-----------------------------------------

x' = Sx * x
y' = Sy * y


-----------------------------------------
2D SCALING MATRIX
-----------------------------------------

S = | Sx   0 |
    | 0    Sy |


-----------------------------------------
MATRIX MULTIPLICATION
-----------------------------------------

| Sx  0 |     | x |     | x' |
| 0  Sy |  ×  | y |  =  | y' |


After multiplication:

x' = Sx * x
y' = Sy * y


-----------------------------------------
EXAMPLE
-----------------------------------------

Original Point:
P(2, 3)

Scaling factors:
Sx = 2
Sy = 3

Scaling Matrix:

| 2  0 |
| 0  3 |

Point Matrix:

| 2 |
| 3 |

Multiplication:

x' = 2 * 2 = 4
y' = 3 * 3 = 9

New Point:
P'(4, 9)


-----------------------------------------
KEY POINTS
-----------------------------------------

1. Scaling changes the size of an object.
2. Shape remains the same.
3. Uses scaling factors Sx and Sy.
4. If Sx = Sy → Uniform scaling.
5. If Sx ≠ Sy → Differential scaling.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


-----------------------------------------
REFLECTION IN 2D TRANSFORMATION
-----------------------------------------

Definition:
Reflection creates a mirror image of an object
with respect to a line or axis.

The size and shape of the object remain the same,
but the orientation is reversed.


-----------------------------------------
REFLECTION ABOUT X-AXIS
-----------------------------------------

Formula:

x' = x
y' = -y

Matrix:

| 1   0 |
| 0  -1 |

Example:
(3,4) → (3,-4)


-----------------------------------------
REFLECTION ABOUT Y-AXIS
-----------------------------------------

Formula:

x' = -x
y' = y

Matrix:

| -1   0 |
|  0   1 |

Example:
(3,4) → (-3,4)


-----------------------------------------
REFLECTION ABOUT ORIGIN
-----------------------------------------

Formula:

x' = -x
y' = -y

Matrix:

| -1   0 |
|  0  -1 |

Example:
(3,4) → (-3,-4)


-----------------------------------------
KEY POINTS
-----------------------------------------

1. Reflection produces a mirror image.
2. Shape and size do not change.
3. Only the direction/orientation changes.
4. Reflection can occur about X-axis, Y-axis,
   origin, or line y = x.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


-----------------------------------------
SHEARING IN 2D TRANSFORMATION
-----------------------------------------

Definition:
Shearing is a transformation that shifts one part
of an object in a particular direction while
keeping the other part fixed.

It changes the shape of the object but the area
remains the same.

Shearing makes objects look slanted or tilted.

Shx = shear factor in x-direction
Shy = shear factor in y-direction


-----------------------------------------
X-SHEARING FORMULA
-----------------------------------------

x' = x + Shx * y
y' = y


-----------------------------------------
X-SHEARING MATRIX
-----------------------------------------

Shx = | 1   Shx |
      | 0    1  |


-----------------------------------------
MATRIX MULTIPLICATION
-----------------------------------------

| 1  Shx |     | x |     | x' |
| 0   1  |  ×  | y |  =  | y' |


After multiplication:

x' = x + Shx * y
y' = y


-----------------------------------------
Y-SHEARING FORMULA
-----------------------------------------

x' = x
y' = y + Shy * x

Original Point:
P(2,3)

Shear factor:
Shx = 2

X-Shearing Matrix:

| 1  2 |
| 0  1 |

Point Matrix:

| 2 |
| 3 |

Multiplication:

x' = 2 + (2*3) = 8
y' = 3

New Point:
P'(8,3)


-----------------------------------------
KEY POINTS
-----------------------------------------

1. Shearing shifts part of the object.
2. Shape changes but area remains the same.
3. There are two types: X-shear and Y-shear.
4. X-shear shifts points horizontally.
5. Y-shear shifts points vertically.

1️⃣ What is a Window?

A Window is the area of the scene we choose to see.
Imagine a large picture, but you look at only one small part.
That selected part is called Window.

Example

Think of a map of India, but you only want to see Gujarat.
The selected part (Gujarat) = Window

+-----------------------------+

The small box is the Window.



2️⃣ What is a Viewport?

A Viewport is the area on the screen where the window is displayed.

So:

Window → what part of scene we select
Viewport → where it appears on screen

3️⃣ Relationship (Very Important)

Process:

World Scene
     ↓
Select Window
     ↓
Map it to Viewport
     ↓
Display on Screen

So the window content is mapped to the viewport.


4️⃣ Simple Real-Life Example

Imagine:

📷 Camera

Camera frame = Window
Phone screen where photo appears = Viewport



5️⃣ Difference Between Window and Viewport

| Window                              | Viewport                         |

| Shows what part of scene to display | Shows where it appears on screen |
| Exists in virtual world             | Exists on display device         |



6️⃣ Very Short Exam Definition

Window:
A window is the selected area of the world coordinate system that we want to display.

Viewport:
A viewport is the area of the display device where the window is mapped.

      question: "22. Explain Viewing Transformation Pipeline.",
      answer: "📌 Important long answer.",
      codeExample: `
In Computer Graphics, objects are created in a big virtual world, but the computer must convert them 
step-by-step to screen pixels.

This process is called Viewing Transformation Pipeline.



Viewing Transformation Pipeline

It is the process of converting object coordinates from world space to screen display coordinates.

Simple flow:

World Coordinates
       ↓
Viewing Coordinates
       ↓
Normalized Coordinates
       ↓
Device Coordinates (Screen)



1️⃣ World Coordinate System (WCS)

This is the original coordinate system where objects are created.
All objects exist in a large virtual world.

Example coordinates:

A (10 , 20)
B (30 , 40)
C (50 , 60)


Diagram idea:

World Coordinate System

      Y
      |
      |        *
      |    *
      |
------|---------------- X
      |
      |           *

So WCS = complete scene or world space.



2️⃣ Viewing Coordinate System (VCS)

Now we choose which part of the world we want to see.
This is done by placing a camera or viewing position.
It converts world coordinates → viewer coordinates.
Think of it like placing a camera in the world.

Example:

    Camera sees only selected objects



3️⃣ Normalized Viewing Coordinates (NVC)

Now the selected area is scaled into a standard range.

Usually the range is:

    0 to 1

So all coordinates become normalized.

Example:

    Original range → 0 to 1 range

Example conversion:

    (20 , 40)  →  (0.4 , 0.6)

This makes calculations easier for the system.



4️⃣ Device Coordinates (DC)

Finally the normalized coordinates are converted into screen pixels.

Example screen resolution:

    800 × 600 pixels

Example:

    (0.4 , 0.6) → (320 , 360)

Now the point can be drawn on the monitor.

|                            |
+----------------------------+

The object inside the window appears inside the viewport.



1️⃣ Scaling Transformation

The size of the window and viewport may be different, so we must scale the object.

Example:

Window size  = 100 × 100
Viewport size = 500 × 500

So the object becomes larger.

Scaling formulas:

Sx = Viewport Width / Window Width
Sy = Viewport Height / Window Height

Meaning:

Sx → horizontal scaling
Sy → vertical scaling

This resizes the object to fit inside the viewport.



2️⃣ Translation

After scaling, the object must be moved to the correct viewport position.
So we apply translation.

Example:

Move object to viewport starting position
Translation moves the coordinates so they align with the viewport location.



3️⃣ Maintaining Relative Position

This means:

Objects inside the window keep their same relative positions after mapping.

Example:

Window

A        B
   C


After transformation:

Viewport

A        B
   C

The distance ratio between objects stays the same.

Only size and position change, not the layout.
Complete Transformation Idea



The process is:

1. Select Window
2. Scale objects to match viewport size
3. Translate to viewport position
4. Maintain relative position


Simple Table (for exam writing)

| Step              | Purpose                          |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Scaling           | Adjust size to fit viewport      |
| Translation       | Move object to viewport position |
| Relative Position | Maintain object layout           |



One Line Exam Definition

Window to Viewport Transformation is the prceoss of mapping coordinates from the window to the 
viewport using scaling and translation while maintaining atirelve positions.
      

------------------------------------------------------------------------


Example: Window → Viewport Transformation

Given

Window coordinates

xwmin = 10
ywmin = 20
xwmax = 60
ywmax = 70


Viewport coordinates

xvmin = 100
yvmin = 200
xvmax = 300
yvmax = 400


Point inside window

P (20 , 40)

We want to find the viewport point (xv , yv).



Step 1️⃣ Find Window Size

Window width

= xwmax − xwmin
= 60 − 10
= 50

Window height

= ywmax − ywmin
= 70 − 20
= 50


Step 2️⃣ Find Viewport Size

Viewport width

= xvmax − xvmin
= 300 − 100
= 200

Viewport height

= yvmax − yvmin
= 400 − 200
= 200



Step 3️⃣ Scaling Factors

Sx = (xvmax − xvmin) / (xwmax − xwmin)
Sy = (yvmax − yvmin) / (ywmax − ywmin)

Calculate:

Sx = 200 / 50 = 4
Sy = 200 / 50 = 4



Step 4️⃣ Transformation Formula

Viewport coordinates:

xv = xvmin + (xw − xwmin) Sx
yv = yvmin + (yw − ywmin) Sy



Step 5️⃣ Substitute Values

X coordinate

xv = 100 + (20 − 10) × 4
xv = 100 + 10 × 4
xv = 100 + 40
xv = 140


Y coordinate

yv = 200 + (40 − 20) × 4
yv = 200 + 20 × 4
yv = 200 + 80
yv = 280


Final Answer

Window Point  : (20 , 40)
Viewport Point: (140 , 280)

So the point moves from window to viewport.



Short Exam Format (You Can Copy)

Sx = (xvmax − xvmin) / (xwmax − xwmin)
Sy = (yvmax − yvmin) / (ywmax − ywmin)

xv = xvmin + (xw − xwmin) Sx
yv = yvmin + (yw − ywmin) Sy

      codeExample: `
1️⃣ First idea: What problem does clipping solve?

Imagine a window (visible area) on the screen.

+-------------+
|             |
|   Visible   |
|    Area     |
|             |
+-------------+


Some objects may be:

    inside the window
    outside the window
    partly inside

The computer should display only the part inside the window.
That process is called Clipping.


Simple Definition

Clipping is the process of removing the parts of objects that lie outside the viewing window.

Types:

Point Clipping
Line Clipping
Polygon Clipping
Curve Clipping
Text Clipping


Types of Clipping

1️⃣ Point Clipping

This checks whether a point lies inside the window or outside.

Window boundaries:

xmin ≤ x ≤ xmax
ymin ≤ y ≤ ymax

Example:

Window

+---------+
|         |
|   •A    |
|         |
+---------+

Point A is inside → it will be displayed.
If a point is outside → it will not be displayed.



2️⃣ Line Clipping

Sometimes a line crosses the window boundary.

Example:

Line before clipping

      /
     /
+---------+
|        /|
|       / |
|      /  |
+-----/---+

After clipping:

+---------+
|        /|
|       / |
|      /  |
+---------+

Only the part of line inside the window is shown.



3️⃣ Polygon Clipping

A polygon is a shape with many sides.

Example:

Triangle / Rectangle / Pentagon
If a polygon crosses the window boundary, the system removes the outside part.

Before clipping

     /\\ 
    /  \\ 
+--------+
|   /\\   |
|  /  \\  |
+--------+

After clipping

+--------+
|   /\\   |
|  /  \\  |
+--------+

Only the visible part remains.



4️⃣ Curve Clipping

This is used for curves like circles or arcs.

Example:

Circle before clipping

   ( )
 +------+
 |      |
 |      |
 +------+

After clipping:

 +------+
 |  )   |
 |      |
 +------+

Only the curve inside the window is shown.



5️⃣ Text Clipping

This is used when text goes outside the window.

Example:

Before clipping

HELLO WORLD
+------+
|HELLO |
|WORLD |
+------+

After clipping:

+------+
|HELLO |
|WORL  |
+------+

Only the text inside the window is displayed.

Explain:

Region codes
9 regions concept
Inside / outside test
Logical AND operation
      


Cohen–Sutherland Line Clipping Algorithm

It is a line clipping algorithm used to remove the parts of a line that lie outside the clipping window.
Only the portion inside the window is displayed.


1️⃣ 9 Regions Concept

The window divides the space into 9 regions.

        TOP-LEFT    TOP      TOP-RIGHT
           1001     1000       1010

        LEFT       WINDOW      RIGHT
           0001     0000       0010

        BOTTOM-LEFT BOTTOM  BOTTOM-RIGHT
           0101      0100       0110

Center region 0000 is the window.
All other regions are outside areas.
Each region has a 4-bit region code.



2️⃣ Region Codes

Each point of the line gets a 4-bit binary code.

The bits represent:

TOP
BOTTOM
RIGHT
LEFT

Example format:

TOP  BOTTOM  RIGHT  LEFT

Examples:

| Position        | Code |
| --------------- | ---- |
| Inside window   | 0000 |
| Left of window  | 0001 |
| Right of window | 0010 |
| Bottom          | 0100 |
| Top             | 1000 |

So every point of the line gets a region code.



3️⃣ Inside Test (Trivial Accept)

If both endpoints have region code 0000

Point1 = 0000
Point2 = 0000

Then the line is completely inside the window.

Result:

Accept the line (draw it completely)



4️⃣ Outside Test (Trivial Reject)

If the logical AND of both region codes ≠ 0

Example:

Point1 = 1000
Point2 = 1000

Logical AND:

1000
1000
-----
1000  (not zero)

This means the line is completely outside the window.

Result:

Reject the line



5️⃣ Logical AND Operation

The algorithm performs bitwise AND on the region codes.

Example:

Code1 = 1001
Code2 = 1000
1001
1000
-----
1000

If result ≠ 0, the line is outside.
If result = 0, the line may intersect the window and must be clipped.



6️⃣ Partial Line Case

If:

Code1 ≠ 0000
Code2 ≠ 0000
AND result = 0

Then the line crosses the window boundary.
The algorithm finds the intersection point with the window edge and clips the outside part.


Steps of the Algorithm (Exam Format)

1. Assign region codes to both endpoints of the line.
2. If both codes are 0000, accept the line.
3. If logical AND of codes ≠ 0, reject the line.
4. Otherwise, calculate the intersection with window boundary.
5. Replace the outside point with the intersection point.
6. Repeat until the line is accepted or rejected.

COHEN–SUTHERLAND LINE CLIPPING EXAMPLE
-----------------------------------------

Clipping Window:

xmin = 10
xmax = 50
ymin = 10
ymax = 50


-----------------------------------------
LINE ENDPOINTS
-----------------------------------------

P1 (5 , 20)
P2 (40 , 60)

We must check if the line is inside or outside
the clipping window.


-----------------------------------------
STEP 1 : FIND REGION CODES
-----------------------------------------

Region code format:

TOP  BOTTOM  RIGHT  LEFT


For Point P1 (5 , 20)

Check position:

x = 5  < xmin (10)  → LEFT
y = 20 is inside vertical range

Region code:

0001


For Point P2 (40 , 60)

Check position:

x = 40 inside horizontal range
y = 60 > ymax (50) → TOP

Region code:

1000


-----------------------------------------
STEP 2 : INSIDE TEST
-----------------------------------------

If both region codes = 0000
→ line is completely inside.

Here:

P1 = 0001
P2 = 1000

So the line is NOT completely inside.


-----------------------------------------
STEP 3 : OUTSIDE TEST (LOGICAL AND)
-----------------------------------------

0001
1000
-----
0000

Result = 0000

So the line is NOT completely outside.

Meaning:
The line partially intersects the window.

Therefore the line must be clipped.


-----------------------------------------
STEP 4 : FIND INTERSECTION
-----------------------------------------

We clip the point that is outside.

P1 is LEFT → intersect with left boundary.

Left boundary:

x = xmin = 10


Line equation:

y = y1 + (y2 − y1) * (x − x1) / (x2 − x1)


Substitute values:

y = 20 + (60 − 20) * (10 − 5) / (40 − 5)

y = 20 + 40 * 5 / 35

y ≈ 20 + 5.7

y ≈ 25.7


New point:

P1' (10 , 25.7)


-----------------------------------------
STEP 5 : CLIP TOP POINT
-----------------------------------------

P2 is TOP → intersect with top boundary.

Top boundary:

y = ymax = 50


Formula:

x = x1 + (x2 − x1) * (y − y1) / (y2 − y1)


Substitute values:

x = 5 + (40 − 5) * (50 − 20) / (60 − 20)

x = 5 + 35 * 30 / 40

x = 5 + 26.25

x ≈ 31.25


New point:

P2' (31.25 , 50)


-----------------------------------------
FINAL CLIPPED LINE
-----------------------------------------

Original Line:

P1 (5 , 20)
P2 (40 , 60)

After Clipping:

P1' (10 , 25.7)
P2' (31.25 , 50)

Only this portion of the line inside the
clipping window is drawn.

      question: "27. Explain Polygon Clipping (Sutherland–Hodgman Algorithm).",
      answer: "📌 Important algorithm question.",
      codeExample: `
1️⃣ Idea of Polygon Clipping

Polygon clipping removes the parts of a polygon that lie outside the clipping window and keeps only the 
visible portion inside the window.

One commonly used algorithm is:

Sutherland–Hodgman Polygon Clipping Algorithm

It clips the polygon edge by edge against the boundaries of the clipping window.


2️⃣ How the Algorithm Works

The clipping window has four boundaries:

Left boundary
Right boundary
Bottom boundary
Top boundary

The polygon is processed one boundary at a time.

After clipping against one boundary, the resulting vertices become the input for the next boundary.



3️⃣ Clipping Polygon Edges

The algorithm checks each edge of the polygon.
For each pair of vertices:

Previous vertex
Current vertex

It determines whether the points are inside or outside the boundary.


There are four possible cases.

| Case | Previous | Current | Action                               |
| ---- | -------- | ------- | ------------------------------------ |
| 1    | Inside   | Inside  | Output current vertex                |
| 2    | Inside   | Outside | Output intersection point            |
| 3    | Outside  | Inside  | Output intersection + current vertex |
| 4    | Outside  | Outside | Output nothing                       |


-----------------------------------------
CLIPPING POLYGON EDGES
-----------------------------------------

The polygon is processed edge by edge.

For each pair of vertices:
Previous vertex
Current vertex

The algorithm determines whether the points
are inside or outside the clipping boundary.

Four cases are considered:

Case 1:
Previous inside, Current inside
→ Output current vertex

Case 2:
Previous inside, Current outside
→ Output intersection point

Case 3:
Previous outside, Current inside
→ Output intersection point and current vertex

Case 4:
Previous outside, Current outside
→ Output nothing



PROCESSING AGAINST BOUNDARIES
-----------------------------------------

The polygon is clipped against each boundary
of the clipping window sequentially.

Boundaries are:

1. Left boundary
2. Right boundary
3. Bottom boundary
4. Top boundary

After clipping against one boundary,
the resulting polygon becomes the input
for the next boundary.



-------------------------------------------------------

-----------------------------------------
PREVIOUS AND CURRENT VERTEX
(SUTHERLAND–HODGMAN ALGORITHM)
-----------------------------------------

1️⃣ WHAT IS PREVIOUS AND CURRENT VERTEX?

When clipping a polygon, the algorithm checks
each edge of the polygon one by one.

An edge is formed by two vertices.

Example polygon vertices:

A → B → C → D → A


While processing edges:

Edge    Previous Vertex    Current Vertex
AB      A                  B
BC      B                  C
CD      C                  D
DA      D                  A


So:

Previous vertex = starting point of the edge
Current vertex  = ending point of the edge

The algorithm moves around the polygon
vertex by vertex.


-----------------------------------------
2️⃣ SIMPLE POLYGON EXAMPLE
-----------------------------------------

Polygon:

A(20,20)
B(60,20)
C(60,60)
D(20,60)

Traversal order:

A → B → C → D → A


Edges processed:

Edge 1 : A → B
Edge 2 : B → C
Edge 3 : C → D
Edge 4 : D → A


For edge AB

Previous = A
Current  = B


For edge BC

Previous = B
Current  = C

Previous (P) -------- Current (C)


CASE 1 — BOTH INSIDE

+-------------+
|   P ---- C  |
|             |

C


CASE 2 — INSIDE → OUTSIDE

CASE 4 — OUTSIDE → OUTSIDE

P -------- C

+-------------+
|             |
|             |
+-------------+

Output:
Nothing


-----------------------------------------
5️⃣ SIMPLE RULE TO REMEMBER
-----------------------------------------

While checking each edge:

Previous = first vertex of edge
Current  = next vertex of edge


The algorithm moves like this:

P = first vertex
C = next vertex

Process edge P → C

Then move forward:

P = C
C = next vertex

      answer: "",
      codeExample: `
-----------------------------------------
POINT CLIPPING CONDITIONS
-----------------------------------------

Point clipping determines whether a point
lies inside or outside the clipping window.

A point P(x, y) is inside the clipping window if:

xmin ≤ x ≤ xmax
ymin ≤ y ≤ ymax

If both conditions are satisfied:
→ Point is accepted.

If any condition is not satisfied:
→ Point is rejected.


-----------------------------------------
REGION CODE MEANING
-----------------------------------------

Region code (Outcode) is a 4-bit binary code
used in the Cohen–Sutherland Line Clipping Algorithm.

It represents the position of a point relative
to the clipping window.

Bit order:

TOP  BOTTOM  RIGHT  LEFT

Meaning:

0000 → Point is inside the window
1000 → Point is above the window
0100 → Point is below the window
0010 → Point is right of the window
0001 → Point is left of the window

Region codes help quickly determine whether
a line is inside, outside, or partially inside
the clipping window.


-----------------------------------------
VIEW VOLUME
-----------------------------------------

View volume is the 3D region of space that
contains the objects to be displayed.

Only the objects inside the view volume
are visible on the screen.

Objects outside the view volume are clipped.

The view volume acts as the viewing area
for 3D graphics.


-----------------------------------------
NORMALIZED VIEW VOLUME
-----------------------------------------

Normalized view volume is a standard
coordinate system used in computer graphics.

After viewing transformation, the view volume
is mapped into a normalized cube.

The coordinates are typically transformed
into the range:

0 ≤ x ≤ 1
0 ≤ y ≤ 1
0 ≤ z ≤ 1

This standard form simplifies further
processing and rendering in the graphics system.
